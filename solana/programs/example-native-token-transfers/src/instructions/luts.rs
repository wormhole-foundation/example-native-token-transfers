//! This instructions manages a canonical address lookup table (or LUT) for the
//! NTT program.
//! LUTs in general can be created permissionlessly, so support from the
//! program's side is not strictly necessary. When submitting a transaction, the
//! client could just manage its own ad-hoc lookup table.
//! Nevertheless, we provide this instruction to make it easier for the client
//! to query the lookup table from a deterministic address, and for integrators
//! to be able to fetch the accounts from the LUT in a standardised way.
//!
//! This way, the client sdk can abstract away the lookup table logic in a
//! maintanable way.
//!
//! The [`initialize_lut`] instruction can be called multiple times, each time
//! it will create a new lookup table, with the accounts defined in the
//! [`Entries`] struct.
//! An alternative would be to keep extending the existing lookup table, but
//! ensuring the instruction is idempotent (which requires ensuring no duplicate
//! entries) has O(n^2) complexity (since LUTs are append only, we can't keep it
//! sorted), and in the worst case would require ~16k checks. So we keep things
//! simple, and just create a new LUT each time. This operation won't be called
//! often, so the extra allocation is justifiable.
//!
//! Because of all the above, this instruction can be called permissionlessly.
